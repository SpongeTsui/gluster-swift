# Gluster-Swift has moved to Swift-On-File
The Gluster-Swift project is being moved to a new project named [Swift-On-File][].
This new name better represents its nature as a Swift backend that supports
multiple Posix Filesystems, not just GlusterFS. The last released version of 
Gluster-Swift was the [Icehouse release][].
